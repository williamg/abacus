# abacus
An easy to use, intuitive calculator written in Rust.... or at least that's the plan.

## Motivations
The project exists for several reasons:
- I wanted to learn Rust
- The alternatives don't cut it:
  - Wolfram Alpha, while powerful, is pretty slow and is offline.
  - Mathematica, Maple, etc. are not free
  - Other command line calculators either have unintuitive syntax or don't support everything I'd like

## Tasks
### Implemented so far:
- Basic lexing

### Still to Be Implementing
- Parsing
- Evaluating
- REPL
- Variable binding
- Some sort of type system probably
