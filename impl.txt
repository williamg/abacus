Okay so how is this gonna work...

So first, lexing. What kind of alphabet are we looking at?

Numbers: 0-9
	Decimals: .
	(Commas not allowed because it would be tough to distinguish commans
	from function arguments)

Grouping:
	Parens: ( )
	Brackets: [ ]

Operators/Functions:
	Anything that is not a number that is grouped and not whitespace



So let's say we have a definition like follows:

enum Expr {
	Value(Rational),
	BinOp(Operator, Expr, Expr),
	UnaryOp(Operator, Expr)
	Func(Vector<Expr>)
}
